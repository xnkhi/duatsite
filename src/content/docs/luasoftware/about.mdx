In the context of the Duat, Lua Software refers to any piece of software, utility, script, library, or program that is designed to run on a user's physical machine, in which a majority of the software's codebase is written in the Lua programming language.

The software in this category is usually designed specifically for Linux-based and/or Unix-like operating systems, and may function improperly if ran on a different operating system.
